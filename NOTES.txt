## sqlite3 commands
sqlite3 website.db



DO LIST:
* create 4 tables; driver_details, accounts, live_bookings an archive_bookings

and display the table 
* make sure to only allow one booking per registration plate (validate )

* display all the livebookings to the page now
* edit the checkcar page so it looks nice and start maybe comparing number plate to SQL

* MAKE admin secure login, add admin column in accounts column, so when someone logins i can check whther is admin or not.

* break down the index.js page and write websockets in seperate file

* to optimise when retirving bookings from server, try to only send bookings once there is a change in the SQL (advance do this when u finished everything else
talk about it on the report if u dont fininsh it under the evaluation sectrion)

#DO TESTING AND RECORD UR RESULTS IN THE REPORT AT THE SAME time
* VALIDATION FOR registration
*VA;IDATION WHEN BOOKING CAR BOOKING, REG PLATE CANT BE THE SAME
