(HOW TO USE VERSION CONTROL) Version master1
--------------------------------------------------------
1.When you have partially finished a stage in project then just commit those files in master and close codio 
(or u can just close without commiting)

2. when the stage is fully done and you are ready to release that version then first commit all the files in master branch
then create a new branch. go to that branch and merge all master branch files into new branch

3. come back to master branch and prepare for the next version and do step 1 and 2 for the next version.
